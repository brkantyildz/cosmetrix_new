# COSMETRIX
Cosmetrix stands out as an innovative project developed to meet users' needs and make their beauty routines more effective in the cosmetics world. Together with our five-person team, we aimed to provide personalized recommendation systems that help users find the most suitable products for their skin types and quickly discover alternatives to the products they are looking for.

# Project Objectives
What is Cosmetrix and what are its goals?
In today's world, cosmetic product users often face various challenges when trying to find the products they need. At Cosmetrix, we aim to provide innovative solutions to two major problems that users encounter.

The first problem we identified is that users may sometimes find the cosmetic products they are looking for out of stock, and due to a lack of sufficient information, they may struggle to discover similar products, leading to a waste of time. Cosmetrix aims to help users by recommending alternative products that are similar in content to the ones they are searching for, allowing them to access more affordable and highly-rated products more quickly and easily.

Another issue in the cosmetics industry is that users with skin problems may struggle to identify the right products and may end up using unsuitable ones, which can lead to both financial and emotional harm. Therefore, at Cosmetrix, we aim to help users with skin problems choose the products that are most suitable for their skin types.

In conclusion, Cosmetrix is committed to enhancing the shopping experience by offering personalized recommendations that meet users' unique needs and preferences, making it easier to find the right products efficiently and effectively.

# Project Stages

1. Dataset Selection: We identified the datasets to be used in the project. We utilized three different datasets derived from the Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews dataset, which we accessed through Kaggle, and enhanced using the GPT 4.0 model.

2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: We performed data preprocessing and feature engineering on these datasets, followed by data analysis.

3. Determination of Project Requirements: Based on the data analysis, we identified the requirements for the project.

4. Development of Recommendation Systems: We developed two different recommendation systems: one for alternative product recommendations and another tailored to skin issues, based on the identified problems.

5. Visualization: The project was visualized using Streamlit.
